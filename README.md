# AI NPCs

AI-NPC Launcher is a Minecraft mod that launches and controls the AI-NPC client, enabling you to create and interact with NPCs that can move, mine, attack, drop items and chat with players in the game. This mod serves as the launcher for the [AI-NPC](https://github.com/sailex428/AI-NPC) client, which powers the actual NPC functionality. Currently, the AI-NPC's capabilities include basic movement, mining skill, attacking entities, dropping items, and chatting with players.

A example video is coming soon!

## Setting Up LLM Integration  

### **Option 1: OpenAI API Key (Paid)**  

1. **Create an Account**: 
   - Sign up or log in to [OpenAi](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
   
2. **Purchase Credits**:
   - Navigate to [Billing](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview)
   - Add a payment method and add credits to your balance
   
3. **Generate an API Key**: 
   - Navigate to [api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys)
   - Click on the top right on "Create new secret key"
   - Copy the api-key
   
5. **Add the API Key to the Mod**:
   - Set npc.llm.openai.api_key to the API key in the NPCConfig/ai-npc-launcher/launcher-NPCConfig.properties file.
   - Deprecated: This is unsecure: (Use `/setconfig npc.llm.openai.api_key <your_api_key>` in-game to set the key.)  

### **Option 2: Ollama (Local LLM)**  

#### What is Ollama?  
Ollama is a local LLM platform for running AI models directly on your machine, reducing reliance on external APIs.  

#### Installation Steps  
1. **Download Ollama**:  
   - Visit [Ollamas Website](https://ollama.com/) and download the installer for your operating system.  

2. **Install and Run Ollama**:  
   - Follow the setup instructions to install.
   - Download a llm model (i recommend the gemma2 model)
   - Download embedding model: [nomic-embed-text](https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text)
   - Start Ollama and ensure it's running in the background.

3. **Connect to the Mod**:  
   - Use the `/npc add` command with `ollama` as the model type.  
   - Example: `/npc add npcname true ollama gemma2`
   - if your server runs on a diffrent address you can set that via `/setconfig npc.llm.ollama.url <youre server address>`.
